## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the program that is not related to the generate command or traces of potentially sensitive information(eg plaintext or keys remaining in memory), please contact me at cryptoam(At)gmail(D0t)com with the relevant information and potential fixes. Do not create a public pull request.
If you are uncertain, please check the github to see if the problem has been noticed and not been dismissed/closed before.
It may take a while(couple of days) before I respond to any reports and confirm whether the vulnerability is in scope.
If the vulnerability is real and in scope, I will both contact you and create an advisory on this github.
